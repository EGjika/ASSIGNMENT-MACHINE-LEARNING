ASSIGNMENT 1: CARS DATASET Dataset 

Dataset
The Cars Dataset can be found here: (https://ai.stanford.edu/~jkrause/cars/car_dataset.html) 
The Cars dataset contains 16,185 images of 196 classes of cars. The data is split into 8,144 
training images and 8,041 testing images, where each class has been split roughly in a 50-50 
split. 

Objective 
Your clients would like a model that can classify cars found from images taken from traffic 
cameras. 

This assignment will involve exploring the importance of the size of a labelled dataset for 
supervised learning. 

Note: For questions where you are asked to explain or interpret results, please do so within the Jupyter 
notebook (or equivalent) using Markdown
